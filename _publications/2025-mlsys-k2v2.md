K2V2 is a novel KV cache quantization strategy that optimizes memory management through channel-specific mixed-precision quantization. The approach combines sink32 and 25% K-channel precision boost to recover accuracy close to FP16 while significantly reducing memory footprint. Evaluation pipelines implemented with vLLM and SGLang demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for efficient inference.
