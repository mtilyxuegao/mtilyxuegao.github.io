Hello! I'm **Jisen Li**, an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**, graduating in May 2026. My research interests focus on **inference, retrieval and ranking, and AI Agents**. Currently, I am a **Research Intern at Together AI**, working on Speculative Decoding/Quantization.

In the **industry**, I have interned at **Nexa AI**, researching on-device models and AI agents; at **Snowflake**, working on embedded search models and hybrid retrieval systems; and at **TikTok**, developing multimodal recommendation models.

In **academic research**, I have worked at **UIUC U-Lab** researching AI agent communication protocols and multi-agent benchmarking; at the **University of Chicago** researching AI deployment; and at **Tsinghua University** researching computer vision for healthcare.

In my free time, I enjoy **fitness, playing billiards**, and playing **Go and Texas Hold'em poker**. Please feel free to contact me—I would be happy to connect with you!
